# Define your Humio host machines here. Replace `ansible_host` with
# their actual IPs. A typical small cluster has 3 hosts that each
# run with all three roles (humio / kafka / zookeeper). You can add
# more hosts if you prefer. It's best to keep the cluster an odd
# number of hosts though. `cluster_index` should just increment for
# each host in the cluster.

# (`22`). If all hosts share the same port, then you can update

# unique port number, then you can move it to the above section
# and specify it on a per-host basis.

# This sets up a `kafkas` group that contain the same hosts as the
