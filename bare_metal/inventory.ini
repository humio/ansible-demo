# Define your Humio host machines here. Replace `ansible_host` with
# their actual IPs. A typical small cluster has 3 hosts that each
# run with all three roles (humio / kafka / zookeeper). You can add
# more hosts if you prefer. It's best to keep the cluster an odd
# number of hosts though. `cluster_index` should just increment for
# each host in the cluster.

humio1 ansible_host=10.0.0.11 cluster_index=1
humio2 ansible_host=10.0.0.12 cluster_index=2

# These variables are applied to each host.
#
# `ansible_port`: By default, the ansible SSH port being used is
# set to `22`. If all hosts share the same port, then you can update
# it here if something other than `22` is used. If each host has a
# separate port number, then you can move it to the above section
# and specify it on a per-host basis.
#
# `ansible_ssh_private_key_file`: The path to the private key that's
# used to connect to the host machines that are configured by ansible.

# This sets up a `kafkas` group that contain the same hosts as the
# `humios` group. If your kafka hosts aren't the same as your humio
# hosts, then you can remove the `:children` here and specify new hosts
# as seen in the `humios` section above.
